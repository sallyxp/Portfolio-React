 # Usage
 
This repository contains an HTML page and associated files used to demonstrate my current abilities on my journey to become a Full Stack Web Developer. 


The site is one continuous web page, which is mobile-responsive, starting with a short biography.  The navigation bar navigates within the document, taking the user

and various icons & names of technologies used. Beneath the image is also a link to my CV, held on my Google Drive.  In addition this link is also listed above.

The next section contains a parallax image of Birmingham City Centre, and then below it, My Portfolio.

The first item is a Week-Day-Scheduler, there is a brief description of it, a screenshot, a link to its Github Repository and another link to the deployed webpage.

The second item is an earlier project, a random password generator.  There is again an image of its landing page, a brief description, a link to its Github Repository and 
also to its deployed website.

The third item, a Few Fries Short, is a recent group collaboration written in node.js, javascript and mySQL2.  It uses the Model-View-Controller paradigm and allows the user to write reviews and comment on others (if logged into the system).

There is a sticky footer at the base of the page.
