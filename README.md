Home contains an evening image of Birmingham City Centre, and also a direct link to  My Portfolio.

The portfolio tells information of 3 projects.
The first item is a Week-Day-Scheduler, there is a brief description of it, a screenshot, a link to its Github Repository and another link to the deployed webpage.

The second item is an earlier project, a random password generator.  There is again an image of its landing page, a brief description, a link to its Github Repository and 
also to its deployed website.

The third item, a Few Fries Short, is a group collaboration written in node.js, javascript and mySQL2.  It uses the Model-View-Controller paradigm and allows the user to write reviews and comment on others (if logged into the system).

There is a sticky footer at the base of the page.
