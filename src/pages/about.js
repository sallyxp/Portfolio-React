                        <h5> Hello! I am Sally Rodgers and I have been working within the IT Industry for more than 20 years.
                            I have an MSc in Computing Science and had been working particularly as a Database designer and programmer,
                            until
                            a car accident within my family forced an employment gap. Since returning back to work, my work has mostly
                            been
                            within data analysis and reporting. While Coronavirus has meant a hiatus in several activities, I decided to
                            expand
                            my horizons and develop new skills.
                        </h5>
